# Testing with Jest/Enzyme
Learning to use Enzyme to test React components independelty now that I have gained a working experience of React. Unit Tests & Integration Tests with React Router, Redux and Axios/Moxios. 

Multiple test directories located in the same directory as the components they test.
 
# Creating our own Middleware (redux-promise and state schema validator)
I recreated a simpler version of the redux-promise middleware to handle asynchronous dispatched actions.
I also recreated a state validator to ensure that any values added into our store match a specific schema and warns a user if an unsupported value is added.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
